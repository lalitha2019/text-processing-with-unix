#Get the html file
curl -s "https://wordfinder.yourdictionary.com/wordle/answers/" > t.html

#Parsing the html file would have been tedious
#However, going over the contents of the html a few times by manual scanning with the eyes as well as using 'grep' to look for patterns,
#led to an interesting observation that made the task very easy.

#The html file had all wordle answers embedded in one single line
#So, now the task was to break that single line into a format that would make parsing it easy

#The below command gets the part where there's all answers in one single line:
grep -o "pastData.*revealAnswer" t.html > finally.html

#The below command then  breaks the one long line we identified as having all answers, into neat parts
#by breaking it at the comma into a new line
#This can be skipped, as the next command does all the required processing
cat finally.html  | sed 's/,/\n/g'

#Refining further by replacing open brces and brackets with a new line and removing closing braces and brackets and double quotes
#This output file can be used as input for data anlalysis using python or any other preferred language / tool
#Details in this text file can be read as data structures like arrays or tables and used for analysis and visualization
#(it still has a few additional lines that may or may not be helpful in further processing / analysis)
cat finally1.html  | sed 's/[,\{\[]/\n/g'  | sed s/\}//g | sed s/\]//g | | sed 's/\"//g' > cleanAnswers.txt

#Using awk, extract the value parts only
#the purpose of this is mostly an exercise to practice text processing
#as the above file itself can be used as input for data analysis
awk -F':' -f script2.txt cleanAnswers.txt > wordleData.txt
